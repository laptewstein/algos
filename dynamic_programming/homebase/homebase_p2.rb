Suppose we have some input data describing a graph of relationships between parents and
children over multiple generations. The data is formatted as a list of (parent, child) pairs,
where each individual is assigned a unique positive integer identifier.

For example, in this diagram, 6 and 8 have common ancestors of 4 and 14.

               15
              / \
         14  13  21
         |   |
1   2    4   12
 \ /   / | \ /
  3   5  8  9
   \ / \     \
    6   7     11

pairs = [
    (1, 3), (2, 3), (3, 6), (5, 6), (5, 7), (4, 5),
    (15, 21), (4, 8), (4, 9), (9, 11), (14, 4), (13, 12),
    (12, 9), (15, 13)
]

Write a function that takes this data and the identifiers of two individuals as inputs
and returns true if and only if they share at least one ancestor.

Sample input and output:

hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 3, 8)   => false
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 5, 8)   => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 6, 8)   => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 6, 9)   => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 1, 3)   => false
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 3, 1)   => false
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 7, 11)  => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 6, 5)   => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 5, 6)   => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 3, 6)   => true
hasCommonAncestor(pairs, 21, 11) => true

n: number of pairs in the input

pairs = [
  [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 6], [5, 6], [5, 7], [4, 5], [15, 21],
  [4, 8], [4, 9], [9, 11], [14, 4], [13, 12], [12, 9], [15, 13]
